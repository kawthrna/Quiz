<h3 style="text-align: center;">Bullying Must Stop</h3>

Sadly, bullying is common. In a study of young people in the UK, more than half of them said they were bullied. About 1.5 million young people in the UK were bullied last year, and many of these say that they were bullied every day. People who are bullied suffer from depression. Consequently, they avoid spending time with other people, which has a negative effect on their learning because many of them do not go to classes or school. Bullying is a social problem, and it needs a solution from society.<br>

There are numerous types of bullying, and it happens everywhere. It can happen at school, in public or online. Moreover, it is not only physical, such as hitting someone. Bullying can also be with words – saying or writing things that are not nice. Another type of bullying is social. For instance, some bullies choose not to include a person, or they tell other people not to be friends with someone.<br>

When it occurs online, it is called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying happens more frequently than other types of bullying because young people spend too much time each day on their mobiles. One study in the UK found that children under 14 years of age spend as much as 23 hours per week on mobiles, which is similar to the amount of time 14-20 year olds use these devices. Both groups should stop using them this much as it will decrease the amount of online bullying.<br>

Bullying usually involves more people than you might think. Certainly, there are people who bully and those who are bullied. However, some people also help the bully by joining them. This happens frequently on social media. Moreover, there are people who don’t bully anyone directly, but they indirectly support the bullying activity (e.g., by clicking “like”). These people support the bullying by being an audience and sometimes laughing at the victim, or person who is harmed. <br>

To stop bullying we need everyone to stand against it. We should all stop watching without helping the victim, laughing, and ignoring what’s happening. People need to report incorrect behaviour as soon as possible to help everyone to understand that bullying is never OK.<br>
